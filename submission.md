# ðŸ“¤ Submission Report: Sentiment Analysis with Transformers

## ðŸ§© Problem Statement

The goal of this project was to build a sentiment analysis model capable of classifying text reviews as either **positive** or **negative**. The challenge involved selecting a robust architecture, preprocessing the dataset appropriately, and evaluating performance using standard classification metrics.

## ðŸš€ Approach

1. **Model Selection**:

   * Chose the Hugging Face model `distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`, which is a distilled version of BERT.
   * This model is lighter and faster than BERT while retaining 95%+ of its performance.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:

   * Used `AutoTokenizer` to tokenize text data.
   * Applied padding and truncation to standardize input lengths.
   * Ensured proper mapping of input features and sentiment labels.

3. **Training Strategy**:

   * Fine-tuned the pre-trained transformer using Hugging Faceâ€™s `Trainer` API.
   * Split dataset into 80% training and 20% testing using `train_test_split`.
   * Configured training parameters with `TrainingArguments`.

4. **Evaluation**:

   * Evaluated the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
   * Visualized results using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for better interpretability.

## ðŸ§  Model Decisions

* **Why DistilBERT**:

  * Faster training and inference.
  * Already fine-tuned on SST-2, a sentiment classification benchmark dataset.
  * Suitable for real-time or resource-constrained applications.

* **Frameworks Used**:

  * Hugging Face `transformers` for modeling and training.
  * Scikit-learn for evaluation.
  * `datasets` for managing and preprocessing the dataset.

## ðŸ“š Key Learnings

* Hugging Face simplifies transformer-based NLP workflows significantly.
* Even pre-trained models require careful preprocessing (e.g., correct token-label mapping).
* Evaluation metrics and visualizations provide deep insights into model behavior.
* Model generalization can vary based on the tokenization scheme and data quality.

## âœ… Next Steps

* Experiment with different transformer architectures like RoBERTa and ALBERT.
* Incorporate cross-validation for more robust evaluation.
* Add error analysis to investigate misclassifications.
* Explore techniques like model distillation or quantization for deployment.
