# üß† Model Report: Sentiment Analysis using Transformer

## üìê Model Architecture Decisions

* **Model Chosen**: [`distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`](https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english), a lightweight version of BERT, was used.
* **Framework**: Hugging Face's `transformers` library.
* **Architecture Details**:

  * Used `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` with `num_labels=2` indicating binary classification (positive/negative sentiment).
  * Tokenizer: `AutoTokenizer` from the same pre-trained model.
  * The tokenizer handles padding and truncation for efficient input processing.
  * Model is fine-tuned on a labeled dataset, where `"tokens"` is the text input and `"target"` is the sentiment label.

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Training Insights

* **Dataset Preprocessing**:

  * Tokenization done using `tokenizer(..., padding="max_length", truncation=True)`.
  * Labels explicitly assigned to tokenized data as `tokens["labels"] = example["target"]`.
  * Dataset was split into train and test sets using an 80/20 split.

* **Training Setup**:

  * `TrainingArguments` and `Trainer` from Hugging Face are employed.
  * Default fine-tuning strategy with `Trainer()` was used.
  * Evaluation includes standard metrics and confusion matrix plotting.

* **Evaluation Metrics**:

  * `accuracy_score`, `precision_recall_fscore_support`, `classification_report`, and `confusion_matrix` are calculated post-prediction.
  * Visualization tools like `matplotlib` and `seaborn` used to understand model performance better.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Improvements and Optimization Notes

* The model chosen is already fine-tuned on a similar SST-2 sentiment dataset, offering a strong baseline.
* Improvements made include:

  * Adjusting the tokenization to ensure label alignment.
  * Leveraging `Trainer`'s built-in capabilities for efficient training and evaluation.
  * Confusion matrix and F1-score insights used to interpret misclassifications.

## üîç Suggestions for Future Enhancements

* Try using other transformer architectures like `roberta-base`, `albert`, or `electra` for comparison.
* Perform hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, batch size, epochs).
* Add early stopping and learning rate schedulers to stabilize training.
* Experiment with domain-specific data augmentation if applicable.
